# Project Theseus
## Summary
Project Theseus is a 3d isometric roguelike where you play as an entity as it attempts to fight its way through rooms to reach the creature calling it from the depths of the abandoned testing site. 

## Mechanics 
The entity can attach and detach its libs to create the most optimal body structure to survive.  Its head, arms, legs and body can be replaced with parts they find, giving them different effects and abilities.  They are also susceptible to the various potions and unstable items lying around the facility, providing upgrades and other effects to the entity.
